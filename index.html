										<!-- About me -->
											<h2 id="content">My name is Isabela Barbosa</h2>
											<p>In all my professional experiences, I have always been bothered by manual and repetitive tasks â€” those routine responsibilities that everyone performs, often thinking there must be a faster, more efficient way but seldom taking the time to figure it out. For instance, during my tenure at General Electric in the Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) department, our team was tasked with creating a presentation showcasing the main accidents and incidents across all units, compiled by the Corporate team. Our job involved translating reports and assembling a PowerPoint presentation for sharing with employees. After a few months of putting together these presentations, I noticed a pattern and developed a template to streamline the process, making the task less burdensome. </p>
											<p>Another example stems from my role as an Administrative Support Agent at a major hospital in my hometown. The waiting list records for surgeries were stored in Excel tables, and apart from diagnosis and case severity, one of the criteria for surgery prioritization was the waiting time. Technical teams often had to navigate through tables, manually checking dates and performing calculations to compare how long patients had been waiting. While my Excel skills were not top-notch at the time, I had friends from college who were proficient, and after discussing with my supervisor, they helped me implement features that automatically calculated this time, saving the precious time of the technical team.</p>
											<p>I ventured into the field of data in 2021 while studying Digital Marketing and collaborating with local businesses to enhance their digital presence. Initially, I began studying Data Science through YouTube videos, particularly through the channel of the beloved Alex the Analyst. Subsequently, I discovered Women in Data and the DS Community, Brazilian institutions dedicated to promoting the development of professionals aspiring to enter the data field or enhance their skills. Beyond technical skill courses and projects using public data, simulating those in real companies, these communities provide career mentorship with experienced data professionals, book clubs, study groups, hackdays, lectures, and discussions to foster the development of soft skills among participants.</p>
											<p>Engaging in discussions and receiving feedback from professionals with varying technical expertise accelerates my professional growth, instilling confidence in my ability to deliver positive results in a data-driven organization.</p>
											<p>Now, with a passion for leveraging data to derive insights and drive decisions, I am excited to share my data science projects portfolio, showcasing how I apply my skills to solve real-world challenges and contribute to data-driven success.</p>

											<h3>Predictive Insights: Leveraging Data and ML for Enhanced Sales Predictions in a Pharmacy Chain.</h3>
											<p>This project aims to enhance a pharmacy chain's performance by leveraging data and machine learning to accurately predict sales numbers. A decision tree-based regression algorithm was developed to forecast sales for the next six weeks across 1,115 stores. The algorithm, deployed on a cloud platform, achieved approximately 10% error (MAPE) after validation. To facilitate easy access to predictions, a Telegram bot was created to provide sales forecasts for specific stores upon request.</p>
											<h4>Tools used for this project</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn.</li>
												<li>Boruta, Sklearn, Scipy.</li>
												<li>Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor</li>
												<li>Regression Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE</li>
												<li>Telegram Bot, Flask, Heroku Cloud</li>

											<h3>Food Marketplace Data Analysis and Insights Dashboard.</h3>
											<p>In this project, I used Python programming, data manipulation, strategic thinking, business logic programming and other technical skills to create a user-friendly dashboard for a food delivery marketplace. The dashboard is easy to use and undestand and shows important information about how the company is doing.</p>
											<p>The final outcome of the project is hosted on a Cloud environment and accessible via a web link. You can check it from any device connected to the internet. The project highlights my ability to bridge the gap between technical complexity and user-friendly design, ultimately delivering a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.</p>

											<h3>12 months sales forecast for a B2B company.</h3>
											<p>I used the historical data to forecast how sales numbers were expected to be in a 12 months data frame, if the company would keep its operations as it is. I analyzed data from organic and paid marketing channels to see which one would bring more leads and better conversion rates and should have more investments. <br /><b>This analysis enables the company to understand how the company is growing and take actions with advanced time</b>, in case the predictions are bellow the expectations.</p>
											<h4>Tools used for this project</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Charts, Solver</li>
												<li>Python, Pandas, Datetime.</li>
												<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>

											<h3>RFM Analysis for marketing targeting strategies.</h3>
											<p>Using Google Sheets and its functions, I did a <b>customer segmentation</b> to divide the companyâ€™s clients in 6 clusters: High Value, Core, New, Promising, Need Attention and, Lost.
										 <br />The result of this analysis allows marketers target specifics groups of existing customers with communications and offers that are more likely to be relevant for them. This leads to <b>improvement in customer life time value (LTV), customer retention, customer satisfaction</b> and, <b>increase in response rates</b>. That way, the company will save in marketing and increase its revenue.</p>
